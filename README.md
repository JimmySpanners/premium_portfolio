## Application Architecture & Patterns

### Page Structure Pattern

The application follows a consistent architecture pattern for all major pages:

```
app/
├── page.tsx                    # Server component (page definition)
└── PageClient.tsx              # Client component (complex logic)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Page definitions vs. complex logic
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering with client-side interactivity
- **Maintainability**: Easier to work with and modify components
- **Consistency**: All pages follow the same pattern

**Example Structure:**
```tsx
// app/page.tsx (Server Component)
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import HomePageClient from './HomePageClient';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <HomePageClient />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// app/HomePageClient.tsx (Client Component)
'use client'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
// ... complex logic, state management, handlers

export default function HomePageClient() {
  // All the complex logic here
  return (
    <main>
      {/* Page content */}
    </main>
  )
}
```

### Authentication Flow

The application uses Supabase Auth with a robust authentication system:

We are using Supabase for authentication and have a 
getAdminSession
 function that checks for admin status.

#### 1. **Authentication Provider**
- Manages user session state
- Provides authentication context
- Handles login/logout flows
- Integrates with Supabase Auth

#### 2. **Protected Routes**
- **Public Routes**: Home, Products, About, Contact, Terms, Privacy, cookies
- **Admin Routes**: Admin dashboard, Media management

#### 3. **Authentication Hooks**
- `useAuth()`: Provides user state and auth methods via context
- Automatic session management
- Redirect handling for protected routes

#### 4. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- Database-level security policies
- User-specific data access
- Premium content protection (scalable process, pr-built into your Supabase table structure)
- Admin-only operations

### Supabase Client Usage (**Important**)

All client-side code must use the shared Supabase client instance:

```js
import supabase from '@/lib/supabase/client'
```

**Do not** use `createBrowserSupabaseClient`, `createClientComponentClient`, or any custom client creation in the browser.  
This ensures correct session handling and avoids issues with authentication and RLS.

If you see a warning about "Multiple GoTrueClient instances," check your imports and ensure only the shared client is used.

---

## API Routes Organization

API routes are organized by feature under `app/api/` (auth, gallery, media, pages, etc.).

---

## State Management

- **Local State:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Global State:** Context API for auth state, custom hooks for shared logic
- **Server State:** Server actions for mutations, API routes for data fetching, Supabase client for database operations

---

## Media Management

- **Cloudinary Integration:** Automatic image optimization, responsive delivery, video processing
- **Media Workflow:**
  1. **Upload:** Client → Cloudinary → Supabase
  2. **Storage:** Cloudinary CDN + Supabase metadata
  3. **Delivery:** Optimized images via Cloudinary
  4. **Management:** Admin interface for organization

---

## Database Schema & Security

- **Core Tables:** users, profiles, pages, media, subscriptions, analytics
- **Security Policies:** RLS enabled on all tables, user-specific data access, premium content protection, admin-only operations

---

## Error Handling & User Experience

- **Client-Side:** Toast notifications (Sonner), error boundaries, graceful fallbacks
- **Server-Side:** API route error handling, database error management, authentication error handling
- **UX:** Loading states, error messages, retry mechanisms

## Supabase Database Setup

For full details, see [`supabase/SETUP_README.md`](./supabase/SETUP_README.md).

**Quick Start (Local Development):**
```bash
# 1. Start Supabase locally
supabase start

# 2. Run main initialization script
supabase db reset

# 3. Apply RLS policies
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d your_database -f supabase/combined_rls_policies.sql

# 4. Create first user and promote to admin
#    (See supabase/FIRST_USER_SETUP.md)
```

- The first user should be created via the Supabase Auth Dashboard or your app's sign-up flow.
- After user creation, promote to admin using the SQL in FIRST_USER_SETUP.md or promote_to_admin.sql.

**Production setup:**  
Follow the same steps, but connect to your production database.

---

## Seeding Initial Data

If you need to seed the database with homepage and essential pages, use the provided script:

```bash
node scripts/init-homepage-data.js
```
- This script creates the homepage and other essential pages with default content.
- You can re-run this script after a fresh database setup or when adding new core pages.

## Available Scripts

The project includes several utility scripts for common tasks.  
**Note:** For core database setup and security, always use the SQL scripts in `supabase/` as described above.

```bash
# Seed the database with homepage and essential pages
node scripts/init-homepage-data.js

# Create a new admin user (alternative to SQL-based admin creation)
node scripts/create-admin-user.js

# Check gallery setup
node scripts/check-gallery-setup.js

# Create a backup of the database
./scripts/backup.sh
```

**Other scripts:**
- `scripts/setup-gallery-sections.js` — Sets up gallery sections and policies
- `scripts/check-gallery-setup.js` — Verifies gallery setup is correct
- `scripts/clean-uploads.js` — Cleans up unused uploads

> **Tip:** For all critical database structure, RLS, and admin setup, use the SQL scripts in `supabase/` for consistency and security.

## Database Migrations

#### What are Migrations?
Migrations are version-controlled scripts that track changes to your database schema.  
They help you:
- Keep development and production databases in sync
- Safely evolve your schema over time
- Share changes with your team

#### Migration Workflow

1. **First Time Setup**
   ```bash
   # This will create your local database and apply all migrations
   npx supabase db reset
   ```

2. **After Pulling New Changes**
   ```bash
   # If you see new migration files, run:
   npx supabase db push
   ```

3. **Creating a New Migration**
   ```bash
   npx supabase migration new your_migration_name
   ```

4. **Testing Your Changes**
   ```bash
   npx supabase db reset
   ```

#### Our Migration Files

- The main schema and RLS are managed in:
  - `supabase/supabase_first_init_script.sql`
  - `supabase/combined_rls_policies.sql`
  - `supabase/FIRST_USER_SETUP.md` (guide for first user and admin creation)
- Additional migrations are in `supabase/migrations/` and should be used for incremental changes.

#### Best Practices

- Test migrations locally before pushing to production
- Keep migration files in version control
- Never modify existing migration files after they've been applied
- Always back up your database before running new migrations

#### Troubleshooting

- **Migration failed?**
  ```bash
  npx supabase migration list
  ```
- **Database out of sync?**
  ```bash
  npx supabase db reset
  ```
- **Check database structure**
  ```sql
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  ```

## Backup & Recovery

### Regular Backups

The project includes an automated backup script for the Supabase database:

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

- Backups are stored in the `./backups` directory with timestamps for easy tracking.
- It is recommended to run this script before applying new migrations or making major changes.

### Disaster Recovery

A comprehensive disaster recovery plan is available in [`docs/disaster_recovery_plan.md`](./docs/disaster_recovery_plan.md), covering:
- Backup procedures and schedules
- Step-by-step recovery process
- Testing and verification steps
- Documentation requirements
- Emergency contact procedures

```

**Notes:**
- Root Pages (like `/home`, `/products`, `/about`) use `root_page_components`.
- Custom Pages (user-created pages) use the `custom_pages` table.
- The `/api/pages/list` route only shows custom pages from the `custom_pages` table, not root pages. Root pages show in the standard nav menu links.

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables for development:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Cloudinary Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

## Security & Best Practices

- **Row Level Security (RLS):** All sensitive tables are protected by RLS, with policies managed in `supabase/combined_rls_policies.sql`.
- **Admin User Management:** Admin users are created and verified via the SQL scripts in `supabase/` or via secure admin scripts. Always use strong, unique passwords and change them after first login.
- **Environment Variables:** Never commit secrets or credentials to version control. Use `.env.local` for local development and environment variables for production.
- **Backups:** Run `./scripts/backup.sh` before major changes or migrations. Store backups securely.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Follow the plan in `docs/disaster_recovery_plan.md` for backup and restore procedures.
- **Code Reviews:** All changes should be reviewed via Pull Requests. Use the security checklist in `supabase/SETUP_README.md` after major updates.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review RLS policies, admin access, and database logs for unusual activity.

## Admin User Management

### Creating a New Admin User

If you need to create a new admin user for the application, you can use the following script. This script will:
1. Create a new user in Supabase Auth
2. Set that user as the application administrator

**Step 1: Create the script file**

Create a new file at `scripts/create-new-admin.js` with the following content:

```javascript
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');

// --- Configuration ---
const newAdminEmail = 'your-new-admin@example.com';  // Change this to your desired email
const newAdminPassword = 'your-secure-password';     // Change this to your desired password

// --- Supabase Credentials ---
const supabaseUrl = 'https://kohpccphgpdzcawxmviu.supabase.co';
const supabaseServiceRoleKey = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImtvaHBjY3BoZ3BkemNhd3htdml1Iiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODY3OTQwNSwiZXhwIjoyMDY0MjU1NDA1fQ.WH6SZjzGp14dgveicznlN6YR6zd_0yRXtNamkoWQkS0';

// --- Script Logic ---
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceRoleKey, {
  auth: {
    autoRefreshToken: false,
    persistSession: false
  }
});

async function createNewAdmin() {
  console.log(`--- Step 1: Creating user for ${newAdminEmail}... ---`);

  // Step 1: Create the user in Supabase Auth
  const { data: userData, error: userError } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
    email: newAdminEmail,
    password: newAdminPassword,
    email_confirm: true, // Auto-confirm the email so they can log in immediately
  });

  if (userError) {
    // Check if the error is because the user already exists
    if (userError.message.includes('User already registered')) {
      console.log(`User ${newAdminEmail} already exists. Skipping creation.`);
    } else {
      console.error('Error creating user:', userError.message);
      console.error('Aborting script.');
      return;
    }
  } else {
    console.log(`✅ User ${userData.user.email} created successfully.`);
  }

  console.log(`--- Step 2: Setting ${newAdminEmail} as the application admin... ---`);

  // Step 2: Set this new user as the admin in the app_settings table
  const { error: settingsError } = await supabase
    .from('app_settings')
    .upsert({ key: 'admin_email', value: newAdminEmail }, { onConflict: 'key' });

  if (settingsError) {
    console.error('Error updating admin email setting:', settingsError.message);
  } else {
    console.log('✅ Admin email setting updated successfully.');
  }

  console.log('---');
  console.log('🚀 All done! You can now log in with the new admin account.');
  console.log(`   Email: ${newAdminEmail}`);
  console.log(`   Password: ${newAdminPassword}`);
  console.log('---');
  console.log('SECURITY WARNING: Please delete this script file now.');
  console.log('---');
}

createNewAdmin();
```

**Step 2: Update the configuration**

Before running the script, make sure to update these variables at the top of the script:
- `newAdminEmail`: Set to the email address you want to use for the admin account
- `newAdminPassword`: Set to a secure password for the admin account

**Step 3: Run the script**

```bash
node scripts/create-new-admin.js
```

**Step 4: Clean up (IMPORTANT)**

After the script runs successfully, **delete the script file** to remove the hardcoded credentials:

```bash
rm scripts/create-new-admin.js
```

### Verify User by user ID

UPDATE auth.users
SET email_confirmed_at = NOW()
WHERE id = '178a0c11-d11e-462a-8c64-441534e5b774';

### Important Security Notes

- **Use strong passwords**: The admin account has full access to the application
- **Delete the script**: Always remove the script file after use to prevent credential exposure
- **Change passwords**: Consider changing the admin password after first login
- **Limit access**: Only create admin accounts for trusted users who need administrative access

### Troubleshooting

- **User already exists**: The script will skip creation if the email is already registered
- **Database errors**: Ensure your Supabase credentials are correct and the service has proper permissions
- **Login issues**: Make sure the `app_settings` table exists and has the correct structure

## Key Component Guide

To help future developers, here's a guide to some of the most important components and their roles in the application.

### Members Management Components

There are several components for managing and displaying members, each with a specific purpose and location:

#### 1. `MembersManager.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Main, feature-rich component for managing members (table, search, filters, add member, etc.)
- **Location:** Displayed on the main `/members` page for administrators.
- **Data Source:** Fetches live user data from Supabase via the `getMembers` server action.
- **File Path:** `components/admin/MembersManager.tsx`

#### 2. `NewMembersTable.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Displays the members table in the admin dashboard, with search and update features.
- **Location:** `/admin/members` page for administrators.
- **Data Source:** Fetches live user data from Supabase via the `getMembers` server action.
- **File Path:** `components/admin/NewMembersTable.tsx`

#### 3. `PublicMembersList.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Displays the members table for users (public/member view).
- **Location:** `/members` page for users.
- **Data Source:** Fetches member data using the `getMembers` function from `@/app/actions/members`.
- **File Path:** `components/members/PublicMembersList.tsx`

#### 4. `MembersPageClient.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Renders the testimonials carousel on the `/members` page (not the main members data table).
- **Data Source:** Uses a hardcoded array of testimonial objects.
- **File Path:** `app/members/MembersPageClient.tsx`
